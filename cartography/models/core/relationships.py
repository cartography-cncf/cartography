    Abstract base class representing properties on a CartographyRelSchema.

    This abstract class enforces that all subclasses will have a lastupdated field

    relationship in the Neo4j SET clause during graph operations.

    Attributes:
        lastupdated: A PropertyRef to the update tag of the relationship.

    Required Properties for MatchLink Usage:
        When the CartographyRelSchema is used as a MatchLink, the following
        properties must be defined in subclasses:

        - lastupdated: A PropertyRef to the update tag of the relationship.
        - _sub_resource_label: A PropertyRef to the label of the sub-resource
          that the relationship is associated with.
        - _sub_resource_id: A PropertyRef to the id of the sub-resource that
          the relationship is associated with.

    Attributes:
