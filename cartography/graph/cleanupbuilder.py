    Generate Neo4j queries to clean up stale nodes and relationships.

    This function creates appropriate cleanup queries based on the node schema's
    configuration, handling different scenarios for scoped and unscoped cleanup
    operations.

    Args:
        node_schema (CartographyNodeSchema): The node schema object defining the
            structure and cleanup behavior for the target nodes.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A list of Neo4j queries to clean up stale nodes and relationships.
            Returns an empty list if the node has no relationships (e.g., SyncMetadata nodes).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the node schema has a sub resource relationship but
            ``scoped_cleanup`` is False, which creates an inconsistent configuration.

    Note:
        The function handles four distinct cases:

        1. **Standard scoped cleanup**: Node has sub resource + scoped cleanup = True
           → Clean up stale nodes scoped to the sub resource
        2. **Invalid configuration**: Node has sub resource + scoped cleanup = False
           → Raises ValueError (inconsistent state)
        3. **Relationship-only cleanup**: No sub resource + scoped cleanup = True
           → Clean up only stale relationships, preserve nodes
        4. **Unscoped cleanup**: No sub resource + scoped cleanup = False
           → Clean up all stale nodes regardless of scope

        Nodes without relationships (like SyncMetadata) are left for manual management.

    Generate a cleanup query for matchlink relationships.

    This function creates a Neo4j query to clean up stale matchlink relationships
    that are scoped to specific sub resources. It's used to maintain data consistency
    by removing outdated relationship connections.

    Args:
        rel_schema (CartographyRelSchema): The relationship schema object to generate
            a query for. Must have the following requirements:

            - ``source_node_matcher`` and ``source_node_label`` defined
            - ``CartographyRelProperties`` object with ``_sub_resource_label`` and
              ``_sub_resource_id`` defined

    Returns:
        str: A Neo4j query to clean up stale matchlink relationships, scoped to
            the specified sub resource.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the ``rel_schema`` does not have a ``source_node_matcher`` defined.

    Note:
        - The query includes scoping clauses to ensure only relationships associated
          with the specified sub resource are cleaned up.
        - Relationship direction is automatically determined from the schema configuration.
        - The query uses parameterized values for security and consistency.
