Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure Active Directory) is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service. Cartography can ingest data from Entra to provide visibility into users and tenants in your organization.

This module also supports syncing **Office 365** users and groups, as they are backed by Entra ID.
